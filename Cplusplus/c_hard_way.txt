Install in linux:
Shell commmand:
$sudo apt-get install build-essential

Check version:
$cc --version

How to compile:
$make name_of_file_without_c_extension

Exercise 1 --page 29 ----------------------------------------------------------

ex1.c
Breaking It Down the code:
	Row 1 - An include, import the contentes into this source file using .h
extensions. 
	Row 3 - Multiline comment, start with /* then after many lines, finish
with */
	Row 4 - A more complex version of the 'main' function. For the function
to be complete it needs to return an 'int' and take two parameters: an 'int' for
the argument count and array of char * strings for the arguments.
	Row 5 - To star a body of any function '{', indicates the beginning of a
block. 
	Row 6 - AA variable declaration and assignment at the same time. In C,
statements (except for logic) en in a ';'.
	Row 8 - Another kind o coment, for a single row. '//'
	Row 9 - Fuction 'printf'.
	Row 11 - A return from the 'main' function that the (OS) your exit value.
	Row 12 - The end of 'main' function with '}', end that's the end of
program.

Read the 'man 3 printf', and make notations/jot the symboms with guess about the
means it.

Exercise 2 Using Makefiles to Build --page 32 ---------------------------------

Use Make:
	$make program_name

	# or do that another way:
	$CFLAGS="-Wall" make program_name

	- The Make program Build by steps, check if exist another file with the
	  same name. If no, check by another file that starts whith the same
name. If yes and called with the same name and have it the extension ".c". If
yes check to build ",c" files. If yes, run the command "cc program_name.c -o
name_program" and build the file program_name.

	- The second command, makes the environment variable only
	  while that commands runs. If you want to set the virable, just
export by this command "export CFLAGS="-Wall", without type before.
	- This means that command line option tell the compiler cc to report all
	  warnings.


Extra Credit --page 34 --------------------------------------------------------

	Improve the 'Makefile'

	When there is a make file, that automatize the commands for compile it's
ofly necessary run the command.

$make

	To do this way, the Makefile must be configured like this:

CXXFLAGS=-Wall -g

all: any_name

any_name:
        rm -f ex1
        make ex1
        ./ex1


Exercise 3 -- Formatted Printing -----------------------------------------------

Stopped at page 35 Extra Credit
-I must read man: printf, make and cc (-wall and -g)
