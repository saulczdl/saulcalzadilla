A simple file with writeble to reinforce my study.

Run Docker intance: 

$sudo systemctl docker status
	- if it is running, run the command for start that container that have
	  it the database:

$sudo docker start mariadb1
	- aftar start the container, the prompt will shown "mariadb1", which
	  means the server is online. Now you can access de comand line inside
of database. Juas run the command as follow. 

$sudo docker exec -it mariadb1 -mysql -u saul -p
	- after inform the password you already conected with the server.

$sudo docker exec -it mariadb1 bash
	- makes you access the bash of container and run commands like "mysql",
	  "mysqldump", "apt-get".

To connect with the server using an IP conection, use this command:
$ sudo docker inspect -f '{{range
.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' mariadb1

Then you get the IP adrees and connect using the follow command:
$mysql -h 172.17.0.2 -u saul -p


First STATEMENTS in MariaDB:

	Try the next commands:

> SHOW DATABASE;
	- Show existent databases.

	- Select one database.

	- Display all tables which is in the  database.

> 



Backup a table:
$ sudo docker exec -it mariadb1 mysqldump --user 'saul' -p \ rookery birds >
~/Documents/Data/Study/IT/Develop/Database/birds.sql
	- The "\" tells the shell to that have it more is to follow,
	- The ">" tells the shell to that send the results of the tump to a text
	  file called birds.sql in the chosen folder.
